# MTGA Earnings Calculator
I wanted to write something to calculate my EV/Earnings in Magic without using Excel, so I threw this together.

I am a losing player in limited formats, so I wanted to see what generally would be my expected return on firing them off.

## Requirements
python3.7 

## Setup

You need to provide the calculator an event configuration which is specified in `mtga_event_structure.py`. You can then modify `mtga_earnings_calculator.py` with the amount of trials you want to attempt and what your expected win percentage is.
